# Least Squares Ideal Functions

This repository contains a Python-based implementation for selecting ideal functions using the least squares criterion and assigning test data points based on a deviation threshold.

## Project Overview
The project compares four training datasets with a set of predefined ideal functions to identify the best-fitting models. Test data points are assigned to ideal functions if they satisfy a deviation constraint derived from the training data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies using:
         
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Place the CSV files in the `data/` directory.
3. Install required dependencies.
4. Run the main program:
      
    python src/main.py


## Output
- Selected ideal functions
- Assigned test data points
- SQLite database containing results
- Visualizations illustrating model fit and assignments
